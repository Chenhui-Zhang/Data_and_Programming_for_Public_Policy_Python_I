# Question 1: Begin with the class below and do the following:
#   a) Modify the what_to_watch method so that it takes an optional keyword
#       argument that allows the user to narrow down the random selection by
#       category (e.g. select only from movies with category 'action'), but
#       defaults to the entire list of titles as it does now.
#   b) The what_to_watch method currently raises a ValueError if you use it
#       before entering any movies. Modify it using try/except so that it tells
#       the user what they did wrong instead of raising an error.
#   c) Create a new class called InteractiveMovieDataBase that inherits MovieDataBase.
#   d) Override the add_movie method in your new class so that if it is called
#       without arguments, it instead asks for user input to add a title/year/
#       category/stars, but if it is called with arguments it behaves as before
#   e) Add some appropriate error checking to InteractiveMovieDatabase on the user 
#       input, so that they can't enter something that makes no sense (e.g. title=None
#       or year='dog')
#   f) Add a new method to InteractiveMovieDataBase named movie_rankings, which
#       returns a list of all the titles in the database currently, ordered
#       highest ranking (by stars) to lowest
#
# NOTE: Your final submission should have only TWO classes: one (modified)
#       MovieDataBase, and the new InteractiveMovieDataBase
